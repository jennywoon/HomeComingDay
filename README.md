# Home Coming Day

홈커밍데이(homecoming day)라는 단어는 미국에서 고교 졸업자들이 30년 뒤에 모교를 방문하는 행사를 말합니다. 한국에서는 동창회란 표현이 있기 때문에 홈커밍은 동창회나 동문회, 동기회에서 추진하는 연간 모임이 아닌 학교 등 교육기관에서 공식적으로 추진하는 행사를 가리키는 표현이 되었습니다.[출처 : 나무위키]

학교를 졸업하고도 학연을 그리워하는 한국에서, 아쉽게도 동문을 만날 수 있는 방법은 많이 없습니다. 카카오 오픈채팅, 네이버 카페 등을 이용하여 동창들과 이어지는 것을 넘어 졸업 후에도 선후배를 만날 수 있는 커뮤니티를 만들고자 하는 아이디어에서 시작되었습니다.

대학교 졸업생 동문 사이트 [홈커밍데이 HomeComingDay] 에서 전국의 선후배를 만나보세요!

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
